# Netlify Deployment Troubleshooting

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. "Page Not Found" (404) Error

**Problem**: Your site shows a 404 error or "Page not found" message.

**Solutions**:
- ✅ **Fixed**: Ensure `index.html` is in the `public/` directory
- ✅ **Fixed**: Check that `_redirects` file is in the `public/` directory
- ✅ **Fixed**: Verify `netlify.toml` has proper redirect configuration

**Current Configuration**:
```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### 2. Build Fails

**Problem**: Netlify build process fails.

**Solutions**:
- Check build logs in Netlify dashboard
- Ensure Node.js version is 18 or higher
- Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Test build locally: `npm run build`

### 3. Assets Not Loading

**Problem**: CSS, JS, or images don't load.

**Solutions**:
- Check file paths in your code
- Ensure assets are in the correct directories
- Verify build output in `dist/` folder

### 4. Routing Issues

**Problem**: Direct links to pages don't work.

**Solutions**:
- Ensure `_redirects` file contains: `/* /index.html 200`
- Check `netlify.toml` redirect configuration
- Verify your React app handles routing properly

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Build Output
```bash
npm run build
ls dist/
```

### 2. Test Locally
```bash
npm run preview
```

### 3. Check Netlify Logs
- Go to your Netlify dashboard
- Click on your site
- Go to "Deploys" tab
- Check build logs for errors

### 4. Verify File Structure
```
Frontend/
├── public/
│   ├── index.html          ✅ Must be here
│   ├── _redirects          ✅ Must be here
│   └── vite.svg
├── src/
│   └── main.jsx
├── netlify.toml            ✅ Must be here
└── package.json
```

## Current Configuration Status

✅ **index.html**: Located in `public/` directory  
✅ **_redirects**: Configured for SPA routing  
✅ **netlify.toml**: Proper build and redirect settings  
✅ **vite.config.js**: Correct build configuration  
✅ **Build Test**: Passed successfully  

## If Issues Persist

1. **Clear Netlify Cache**:
   - Go to Site Settings > Build & Deploy
   - Click "Clear cache and deploy site"

2. **Check Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure no environment variables are missing

3. **Verify Repository**:
   - Make sure all files are committed and pushed
   - Check that the correct branch is deployed

4. **Contact Support**:
   - Check [Netlify Support](https://docs.netlify.com/)
   - Review build logs for specific error messages
